# Smart enum
Smart enum - short test library for smart enums in C++.
Implementation is based on materials for SMETA (http://b.atch.se/posts/constexpr-meta-container/attachments/stateful_meta_container-poc.cpp) (stateful meta-programming library) by Filip Ros√©en  	filip.roseen@gmail.com.

Author doesn't know if this tehniques are valid according to the C++ standard and this programs are not ill-formed.
So **it's not recommended to use this library in your production code**. **This library is just an experiment**.
